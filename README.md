## TESLA Stock Price Forecasting using ARIMA and LSTM ##

Two time series forecasting models; **ARIMA** (a traditional statistical model) and **LSTM** (a deep learning model) were used to predict Tesla (TSLA) stock prices. 
The goal was not only to evaluate their statistical accuracy, but also to assess practical usefulness through mock trading simulations. 

## Research Question
Can deep learning models such as LSTM outperform a traditional statistical model like ARIMA in both prediction accuracy and real-world trading profit?

## Dataset
- **Source**: yfinance API from Yahoo Finance
- **Period**: Jan 1, 2021 â€“ April 4, 2025
- **Features**:
  - TSLA: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
  - NASDAQ-100 Index: Close
  
## Models Overview

### **LSTM Model 1**
Predicts the **current day's** TSLA closing price based on **past 60 days** of the historical data. It does not forecast the future, but rather reconstructs present using historical patterns.

  - **Input Features**:
    - TSLA_Close, 10-day Moving Average (MA10), 20-day Moving Average (MA20)
  - **Design**:
    - Two hidden LSTM layers (128 -> 64 units)
    - Final output layer


### **LSTM Model 2**
Forecasts the **next day's** TSLA closing price using **previous 30 days** of multivariate features.
 
  - **Input Features**:
    - TSLA: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
    - NASDAQ Index closing price
  - **Design**:
      - Two hidden LSTM layers (64 -> 32 units), each followed by Dropout (rate = 0.2)
      - Final output layer

### **ARIMA**
**ARIMA (0,1,0) model** was used to model **daily TSLA closing prices**.

After removing non-stationarity through differencing and detrending, a rolling forecast was applied.
    
  - **Preprocessing**:
    - Linear detrending using regression
    - Weekly rolling forecasts
  - **Model Selection**:
    - using auto_arima() from pdarima package
     
## Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE, MAE, Directional Accuracy, Relative RMSE, NAIVE RMSE, Mock Trading Profit

## Mock Trading Simulation
To evaluate real-world performance, simple mock trading simulation was ran. 

### Setup
- **Initial cash**: $10,000
- **Buy 1 share** of TSLA if model preducts that price will go up the next day
- **Sell 1 share** of TSLA if model predicts the price will go down

  * This approach assumes a basic and simple strategy with no transaction fees. 

## Insights
- **LSTM Model 1** had the lowest RMSE, yet made least profit (-$8.54)
- **LSTM Model 2** generated the highest profit (+$567.73), despite a higher RMSE 
- **ARIMA** produced moderate profit (+$72.18), despite having weaker statistical performance

## Moving Forward
  - Include additional macronomic indicators (e.g., GDP, CPI, inflation rates)
  - Explore more advanced architectures
  - Incorporate transaction costs in mock trading for more realistic simulation
